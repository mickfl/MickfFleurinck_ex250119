#question4
select gene_name,(seq_region_end - seq_region_start + 1) as size from gene order by size asc limit 1;
answer
 gene_name | size |
+-----------+------+
| TRDD1     |    8

#question5
select gene_name,count(transcript.gene_id) as amount from transcript join gene on transcript.gene_id= gene.gene_id group by gene_name order by amount desc limit 1;
 gene_name | amount |
+-----------+--------+
| U6        |   1329 

#question6
select chromosome, count(exon_id) as nmbr_of_exons from gene join exon.seq_region_end = gene.seq_region_end where description like '%cancer%' group by gene_name order by nmbr_of_exons limit 1 offset 1;

#question7 Give the number of rows from the exon table and do the same for the exon_transcript table. Explain why there is a difference in number of rows.
select count(exon_id) from exon; 
| count(exon_id) |
+----------------+
|         642590 

select count(exon_id) from exon; 
+----------------+
| count(exon_id) |
+----------------+
|        1178393 |
+----------------+

the difference in amount of rows can be explained because of th table does not only contain the original exons but also te variants of the exons (=transcripts) and al these variants will also have there own exon_id number
